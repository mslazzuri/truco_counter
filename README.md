## 🎮 How to Play Truco

Truco is a trick-taking card game played mainly in Brazil. There are different regional variations — **Paulista (SP)** and **Mineiro (MG)** being the most common. Here’s a simplified explanation of the core game mechanics:

- The game is played with a 40-card deck (removing 8s, 9s, 10s and jokers).
- Cards have a non-standard ranking that can change depending on the flipped card, which defines the **manilha** (trump cards).
- Players score points by winning rounds. Bluffing and calling “Truco!” increases the stakes.
- The game is typically played with 2 teams of 2 players each.
